# SIEM Implementation and Log Analysis using Elastic Cloud
# How to Use a SIEM Tool in a Real-Life Situation

The Detection Lab project focused on utilizing Elastic Cloud to set up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. The focus was on ingesting and analyzing logs to simulate real-world cyber attack scenarios. Through this hands-on experience, the project aimed to enhance understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive measures within a cloud environment

# Skills Learned:

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application in Elastic Cloud.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting security event logs.
- Ability to generate and identify attack signatures and patterns.
- Deepened knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

  # Tools Used:

- Elastic Cloud SIEM for log ingestion and security event analysis.
- Wireshark for capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to simulate realistic attack scenarios.

# Steps

- Deploy an EC2 instance on AWS and install Elastic agents (like Filebeat) for log forwarding.
  Deploy Elastic Stack:

- Set up Elasticsearch and Kibana on Elastic Cloud to collect and analyze logs from the EC2 instance.
  Ingest Logs:

- Use Filebeat or Metricbeat on the EC2 instance to forward logs to Elastic Cloud.
  Analyze Logs in Kibana:

- Create index patterns in Kibana to visualize and analyze logs.
  Simulate Attacks:

- Perform attack simulations on the EC2 instance and analyze the logs for security incidents.
  Set Alerts:

- Configure alerts in Kibana to detect anomalies or attacks in real time.
  Respond to Incidents:

- Take action on detected threats, such as isolating the instance or blocking IPs.
  Continuous Monitoring:

- Monitor logs continuously for new threats and refine your SIEM configuration.
